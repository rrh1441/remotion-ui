# Getting Started with Remotion-UI

Remotion-UI is a comprehensive library of production-ready components, assets, and presets for creating stunning videos with Remotion.

## Features

- **20+ Motion Components** - Titles, transitions, layouts, and more
- **70+ Production Assets** - Icons, shapes, backgrounds, all optimized for video
- **Copy & Paste** - No complex setup, just copy components into your project
- **TypeScript First** - Full type safety with comprehensive prop types
- **Theme System** - Consistent design tokens across all components
- **CLI Tool** - Quick installation and component management

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { TitleCard } from './remotion/ui/components/TitleCard';
import { FadeIn } from './remotion/ui/core/primitives/FadeIn';

export const MyVideo = () => (
  <FadeIn>
    <TitleCard 
      title="Welcome to Remotion-UI"
      subtitle="Beautiful motion components"
    />
  </FadeIn>
);
```

## Philosophy

Remotion-UI follows the same philosophy as shadcn/ui:

1. **Copy-paste, not install** - You own the code
2. **Customizable** - Modify components to fit your needs
3. **Accessible** - Components follow best practices
4. **Production-ready** - Used in real projects
